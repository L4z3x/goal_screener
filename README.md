# Gaol_Screener
a simple python app built with pyqt and pillow to boost your production 
by visualzing your goals/quest in the home background and tracking them
(Ispired by AC valhala quest menu BTW)
 ## Example
 if this is your desktop background:
 
 ![Logo](./example/background.png)
 
 then it will look like this, note that your background img should be clean to make good effect.
 (the little green icon points to the tracked quest)
